## Requirements

`gpt4docstrings` supports Python 3.9 and above.

## Installation

You can install _gpt4docstrings_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
$ pip install gpt4docstrings
```

## Usage

##### Command Line Interface

The first option when using `gpt4docstrings` is to use it as a Command Line Interface (CLI).

The following is an example command that generates docstrings for all the non-documented
classes / functions under `src/` directory.

```bash
gpt4docstrings src/
```

Another quite common situation is that we want to exclude the `tests/` folder, for example,
from the generation of docstrings. Doing this is very simple.

```bash
gpt4docstrings --exclude tests/ .
```

Lastly, you could also run `gpt4docstrings` in a specific Python file.

```bash
gpt4docstrings ./src/example.py
```

Remember that, if you don't have your OpenAI API Key defined as an Environment Variable (OPENAI_API_KEY),
`gpt4docstrings` can accept the API Key as an option.

```bash
gpt4docstrings --exclude tests/ --api_key sk-xxxxxxxxxxxx .
```

##### pre-commit hook

Another cool use of `gpt4docstrings` is as a `precommit` hook.
All you have to do is add it to your configuration file and youâ€™re done!

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/MichaelisTrofficus/gpt4docstrings
    rev: v0.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: gpt4docstrings
        name: gpt4docstrings
        language: python
        entry: gpt4docstrings
        types: [python]
```

Please see the [Command-line Reference] for more details!!
